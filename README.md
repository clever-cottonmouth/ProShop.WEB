   - Check for conflicting dependencies in package.json
   - Ensure all environment variables are properly set

2. **Runtime Errors**
   - Check browser console for detailed error messages
   - Verify API endpoints are accessible
   - Ensure all required environment variables are set

3. **Performance Issues**
   - Clear browser cache
   - Check network requests in browser dev tools
   - Verify image optimization settings

4. **Authentication Problems**
   - Clear local storage
   - Check token expiration
   - Verify API credentials

## Development Guidelines

### Code Style
- Follow ESLint configuration
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Write comments for complex logic
- Keep components small and focused

### Git Workflow
1. Create feature branches from `develop`
2. Follow conventional commits format
3. Write meaningful commit messages
4. Create pull requests for all changes

### Testing
- Write unit tests for new features
- Maintain minimum 80% code coverage
- Test edge cases and error scenarios
- Run tests before committing: `npm test`
